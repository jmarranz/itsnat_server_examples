# GnuPlot Experiment

This web application is "inspired" by this article:

 http://java.dzone.com/tips/java-web-frameworks-survey

 This application is a NetBeans Maven project and is using gp423win32x11.zip for Windows

 Port to other unixes should be trivial.

 GnuplotHelper class is authored by Peter Karich and is slightly modified in this project.
