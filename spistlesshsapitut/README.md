Source code of the tutorial: Single Page Interface *Stateless* SEO Compatible Web Site With ItsNat Using History API

Shows how to build *stateless* (web session is not used) single page interface web sites with the same capabilities as page based
like bookmarking, SEO, JavaScript disabled and visit counters like Google Analytics.

In this example History API is used to simulate page navigation, in browsers with no History API support a degraded real paged based navigation is used
for the "fundamental states".

This web site is developed with ItsNat, NetBeans, Java 1.6 and Tomcat 6.0.

With very minor modifications this program could be ported to any other configuration
supported by ItsNat framework.
