
Example of ItsNat configuration with Spring
--------------------------------------------

* Shows how to configure a simple ItsNat web application with Spring Dependency Injection.

* The example is the "core" example shown in Reference Manual in this case configured with Spring.

* This web application has been developed with ItsNat, NetBeans, Java 1.6 (compiled to
  Java 1.5 binary format), Tomcat 6.0 and Spring 3.

* With very minor modifications this program could be ported to any other configuration
  supported by ItsNat framework.

* Generic code is below the package "itsnatspring" including a servlet "itsnatservlet",
  this code may be reused in any ItsNat project configured by Spring. Utility classes are
  not complete, some configuration options are missing.
  Code below "itsnatex" package is specific of this example.

* This demo was shown first time in SpringIO Congress held in Madrid, February 17-18 2011.
