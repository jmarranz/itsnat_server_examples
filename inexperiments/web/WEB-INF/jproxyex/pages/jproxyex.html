<title>Hot Class Reload of JAVA sources Example based on RelProxy!</title>
</head>
<body> 
    <h1>Hot Class Reload of JAVA sources Example based on <a href="https://github.com/jmarranz/relproxy/" target="_blank">RelProxy</a>!</h1>

    <p>As of Java 1.6 a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/tools/JavaCompiler.html" target="_blank">Java compiler API</a> is exposed to end developers 
       and included in any JDK, in a standard Java EE web environment the compiler is accessible because the JDK is needed to recompile on the fly for instance JSPs</p>
    
    <p>This opens the opportunity to make a hot class reload based on pure Java source code in a similar way to other dynamic languages... fast and avoiding the tedious
    context reload</p>
       
    <h2>So can I change Java source code and automatically reload it on the fly in runtime in production or development time?</h2>    
    
    <h3>Yes!</h3>
    
    <p><a href="https://github.com/jmarranz/relproxy/" target="_blank">RelProxy</a> is a Java and Groovy hot class reloader library, in spite of it is a general purpose
        tool it was conceived to provide hot class reload to ItsNat.
    </p>
    
    <p>This page is rendered by (compiled) Java source code included in the standard WAR file, of course into the WEB-INF folder if you need privacy of your code,
      this Java code can be modified and will be compiled and reloaded on the fly, reload the page and the new code will be executed.</p>
    
    <hr />
    <h2>A simple running example</h2>    
    <br/>
    <div itsnat:nocache="true">
        <span>Say something to hot reloaded Java classes:</span> <br/>
        <input id="inputId" type="text" size="50" /> <button id="buttonId">Send</button>
    </div>

    <br/> 
    <div> You said: <span id="resultsId" style="color:red" itsnat:nocache="true"></span></div>   
    <br/>
    
    <p>Note: try changing the source code in runtime (template and Java code) to modify the behavior of this example and reload this page</p> 
    
    <hr />    
    
    <p>The class <code>JProxy</code> is a Java class to provide a simple proxy for conventional Java objects, 
        When <code>JProxy</code> is used, a <code>java.lang.reflect.Proxy</code> is passed instead of the original Java object, the original Java object is retained 
        under the hood and method calls to the proxy are redirected to the real object
    calling the corresponding method using reflection, when the source code of the Java(s) class(es) changes.
    </p>
    
    <p><code>JProxy</code> automatically reloads the Java class and creates a new object to replace the old one, the fields of the original object are got and re-set to the new
    object to keep the state (number of fields and types must be the same otherwise reloading is not possible and a redeploy is required).
    </p>
    
    <p><code>JProxy</code> part of RelProxy is not so sophisticated like products like JRebel but it could dramatically reduce the number of redeploys in an ItsNat project.</p>    
    
    <p>With a simple <code>boolean enabled</code> param set to false in initialization time, <code>JProxy</code> does nothing and your original objects are returned instead of proxies
       with 0 performance penalty in production. If you still want to make hot changes in production, automatic detection of source code changes can be stopped to reduce footprint in production and started again in any time when we want make
       source code changes.
    </p>
    
    <h3>ItsNat, Java, JProxy and automatic reload</h3>
    
    <p><code>JProxy</code> can easily be applied to an ItsNat project to provide a proxy instead of the original Java object when registering an 
    <code>ItsNatServletRequestListener</code> associated to a page template. When a document (page) is loaded calling <code>processRequest</code>, <code>JProxy</code> re-creates 
    this listener object if the source code of this object <b>or any other dependent class</b> has changed, and re-set all fields to restore the current state.</p>
    
    <p>Field values injected to the class implementing <code>ItsNatServletRequestListener</code> are not (and must not be) reloaded to the new possible source, but cascade dependent classes usually creating
        new objects are automatically reloaded when executing <code>processRequest</code>, any new object created by <code>processRequest</code> is fresh with the last source and because registering in framework ItsNat classes
       happens after reloading no <code>JProxy</code> is needed.
    </p>
    
    <p>This solution is not perfect because only affects to view-logic (not to classes of global objects provided to <code>ItsNatServletRequestListener</code> page loaders), that is, 
       code for <code>ItsNatDocument</code> processing, anyway this is very much code.</p> 
    
    <p>This is an example of using a <code>JProxy</code> when registering a <code>ItsNatServletRequestListener</code> associated to a template for document loading:</p>
    <pre>
ItsNatServletRequestListener listener = JProxy.create(new JProxyExampleLoadListener(db), ItsNatServletRequestListener.class);
docTemplate.addItsNatServletRequestListener(listener);
    </pre>

    <h3>How to test automatic reload in this example?</h3>    
    
    <p>For instance change <code>JProxyExampleDocument</code> and <code>jproxyex.html</code> to change view logic, and reload this page, no redeploy is needed, no servlet context is reloaded, only Java classes are reloaded. 
       The class <code>JProxyExampleDocument</code> contains an inner class, a member class (<code>AuxMember</code>) and using an external class <code>JProxyExampleAux</code>, change these classes with no problem.
       You can change also <code>JProxyExampleLoadListener</code> for instance to change the parameters provided to <code>JProxyExampleDocument</code> but do not add/remove/change its fields because this is the root class and instance
       managed by <code>JProxy</code> in this example and classes of the fields cannot be reloaded, for instance changes to <code>FalseDB</code> (a field of <code>JProxyExampleDocument</code>)
       are not automatically reloaded because <code>FalseDB</code> is not in the folder for class reload and trying to reload this class implies a field of <code>JProxyExampleLoadListener</code> has changed and reloading this class will fail.
    </p>

    <p>In production time Java app servers usually extract deployed war files to internal folders, you can modify sources there.</p> 
    
    <h3>How to include Java source code into the WAR file below WEB-INF?</h3>    
    
    <p>For instance a standard web project in NetBeans based on generated Ant filters .java files when deploying, to avoid this filtering just add:</p>
    
    <pre>
    &lt;target name="-pre-dist"> 
        &lt;copy todir="${build.web.dir}/WEB-INF" preservelastmodified="true">
            &lt;fileset dir="${webinf.dir}" /> 
        &lt;/copy>
    &lt;/target>     
    </pre>
    
    <p>For a web project built with Maven you need to add the extra folder with sources into the compilation, Maven automatically adds any folder below WEB-INF.
    You can use <a href="jproxyex/pom.xml">this POM</a> as a base for your project.</p>
